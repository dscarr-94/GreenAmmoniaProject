# Automation of Entropy Generation Calculations
A Senior Project supported by the Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering departments of California Polytechnic State University -- San Luis Obispo. The project is developed under the advising of Professors John P. O'Connell and William L. Ahlgren. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Running the program is easy, however there are several prerequisites to getting started. Please see down below. 

To begin, git clone the project onto your local machine. This can be done by copying the [github link]("https://github.com/rlandesman/GreenAmmoniaProject.git") (found on the website or the hyperlink) and typing the following into your terminal

```
git clone <link>
```

### Prerequisites

There are several software packages that are neccessary for the successful deployment of this software.

First, Python3 is a must for running the script. Please [install Python3.x ](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Download Page") for your specific operating system 

### Installing

Next, you will need to install the appropriate support libraries. In your command line, please enter the directory into which you installed the project
Then enter the following commands

```
pip install PyYAML
pip install openpyxl
```

Note: All user-requested parameters can conveniently be found in a file titled config.yaml. For testing purposes, these values have been pre-determined, but can be further customized by changing the value fields (strings only) inside this file. 

### And coding style tests

For readability and documentation purposes the Python code was developed accoridng to the steps laid out by Professor O'Connells instructions.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) - User-Input Parser
* [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - MS Excel Python library
